Hello User!
------------
Here is the description of our project, and implemented features. Hope you will find it helpful.

1. The first page of our project is the register page. If you do not have an account in Funbook, you have to register. For this, you need an Email account, and a password! You have to fill up the required fields with caution, cause if you leave the email empty/ use a password less than 6 digit/ do not confirm the right password, it will show an error message. an error message is shown in the photo:

2. If you fill up the fields correctly, and you have internet connection, you will be sent to login page. Also you will see a message "Mail sent". Yes, you have to verify your email account before logging in. Here is the example of how it will look like if you try logging in without verifying your mail.
